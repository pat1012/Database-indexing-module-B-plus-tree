# B+ tree indexing module for Bruin Database
</br>
Designed the leaf and non-leaf node structures of a B+ tree.</br>
Implemented multiple classes and functions to maintain and manipulate the (key, record_ID) pairs. </br>
Implemented the insertion and searching algorithms using recursion. </br>
Implemented  splitting and merging methods of the tree nodes and enabled the tree structure to handle overflow/underflow gracefully, and to grow/shrink dynamically as the number of records changes.  </br>
Modified the SQL engine and implemented some APIs (SELECT, LOAD and command parsing) in order to make use of my indexing module. </br>

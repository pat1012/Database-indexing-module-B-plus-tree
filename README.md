# B+ tree indexing module for Bruin Database (language:C++)

Based on a given skeleton, designed the leaf and non-leaf node structures of a B+ tree.
Implemented multiple classes and functions to maintain and manipulate the (key, record_ID) pairs. 
Implemented the insertion and searching algorithms using recursion. 
Implemented  splitting and merging methods of the tree nodes and enabled the B+ tree structure to handle overflow/underflow gracefully, and to grow/shrink dynamically as the number of records changes.  
Modified the SQL engine and implemented some APIs (SELECT, LOAD and command parsing) in order to make use of my indexing module.
